see http://orca-robotics.sf.net/getting.html for detailed instructions on installing orca.


THE SHORT VERSION
-----------------

Just do:

'cmake .'
'make'
(as root) 'make install'


THE LONG VERSION
----------------

Orca uses cmake (www.cmake.org) for its build configuration.
CMake is a cross-platform build system.



There are a few ways you can do things differently to the short version:


1) Out-of-source builds:

'mkdir Bin'
'cd Bin'
'cmake ..'
'make'


2) GUI Configurator:

Use 'ccmake' rather than 'cmake' for a GUI configurator.
