The Orca project does not, as a policy, require code to conform to any specific 
license to be included in the distribution. However, the code is required to 
have a license and the license must be Open Source. That is the official policy.

The reality of the situation is that nearly all code in the Orca libraries and 
components is covered under the Library GNU Public License (LGPL) as defined by 
the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Most of the remaining code is licensed under 
the GNU Public License (GPL), also defined by the FSF.

The GNU General Public License is often shipped with GNU software, and is
generally kept in a file called COPYING or LICENSE. If you do not have a 
copy of the license, write to the Free Software Foundation, 59 Temple 
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111 USA.

The following is a complete list of subdirectories of the 'src' directory 
in orca2 distribution. For each subdirectory with a distinct license the 
license is listed.
