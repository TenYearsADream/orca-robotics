@page orca_doc_configfiles Orca Configuration Files

\b NOTE: This is not implemented yet but will be soon.

Configuration files can be used for three things:
    - @ref connection
    - @ref config
    - Describing the component structure

Orca uses Ice tools to parse configuration files. These are text files which list properties as key/value pairs. The keys are strings optionally devided into subfields with periods.

@section terms Terminology

When talking about how components connect to each other it's helpful to define some terminology.

A \em platform is a logical unit, a robot would typically be a platform. We use the term platform so not to exclude simple devices like cameras or PDA's. Calling them robots would be a stretch. Platforms are the highest level in our hierarchy, so we don't define teams for example. Each platform can have one or several \em hosts -- physical computers. Each host may execute one or several \em components. Each component may have zero or more \em interfaces, some are required and some are provided.

These four terms are often used in describing a distributed system but one has to be careful to keep in mind that they refer to different aspects of the system. Platforms describe a logical grouping of hardware and software. This grouping is useful because it reflects physical proximity; cheap, fast, and reliable communication, etc. Hosts are units of computing hardware. Components and interfaces describe software organization. Assigning software (components) to hardware (hosts) is called deployment.

@section connection Connecting Components

A component usually has a single config file which may also set some Ice runtime parameters which start with 'Ice', 'IceStorm', etc. We prefix all component settings with a string which we call here 'ComponentTag'. There are two rules about this tag: a) it must be unique within one config file, and b) it has to match the string hardwired into the source code. Let's look at an example.

@verbatim
ComponentTag.Platform=p1
ComponentTag.Component=c1
...
ComponentTag.Provides.InterfaceTag1.Interface=i1
ComponentTag.Provides.InterfaceTag2.Interface=i2
...
@endverbatim

This component has two provided interfaces. When this component is initialized it registers them with the naming service (or the registry) under the following names: \e i1\@p1/c1 and \e i2\@p1/c1. The implementation of ZeroC's IcePackRegistry requires that the interface name must be unique withing an Orca component, and the combination of the platform and component names must be unique within the registy.

@verbatim
ComponentTag.Platform=p2
ComponentTag.Component=c2
...
ComponentTag.Requires.InterfaceTag1.Platform=p1
ComponentTag.Requires.InterfaceTag1.Component=c1
ComponentTag.Requires.InterfaceTag1.Interface=i1
...
@endverbatim

When the second component is initialized it looks up the interface it requires at the naming service under the name \e i1\@p1/c1. The registry returns the address of the first provided interface of the component above. Because we use a slash '/' as a separator, it cannot be used in platform and component names. The \@ sign is also not permitted.

@par A Possible Alternative Syntax

Here's an alternative more concise syntax. It takes precedence is both are present.

@verbatim
ComponentTag.AdapterId=p2/c2
...
ComponentTag.Requires.InterfaceTag1.Proxy=i1@p1/c1
...
@endverbatim

@section config Setting internal component parameters
