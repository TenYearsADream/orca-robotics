@page orca_doc_devadd Adding Interfaces, Components, and Libraries to Orca2

@note Reviewed for release 2.1.0

@section orca_doc_devadd_iface Adding an Interface to Orca2

-# Write a Slice file (*.ice) which defines an interface.
    - Slice files are in @c [ORCA2_SRC]/src/interfaces/slice/orca
    - To create a new interface start by copying a similar file.
-# Add the filename of the new file to the list of Slice sources
    - Edit file @c [ORCA2_SRC]/src/interfaces/slice/orca/slice_sources.cmake

Optionally, consider creating tool plug-ins for your new interface. The following tools have a plug-in structure:
    - @ref orca_component_orcaview
    - @ref orca_component_logger
    - @ref orca_component_logplayer
    - @ref orca_util_probe
    - @ref orca_component_orcamon


@section orca_doc_devadd_comp Adding a Component to Orca2

-# Create a new directory in @c [ORCA2_SRC]/src/components
    - Start by copying the directory of a similar component.
    - Edit the CMake file @c CMakeLists.txt in the new directory
    - Edit the component definition file @c mycomponent.def
    - Edit the documentation file @c mycomponent.dox
    - Modify the names of classes, namespaces, etc. using the name of your component
-# Add an entry for the new directory to the build system.
    - Edit file @c [ORCA2_SRC]/src/components/CMakeLists.txt
    - In alphabetical order, add a line "ADD_SUBDIRECTORY ( mycomponent )"

@section orca_doc_devadd_lib Adding a library to Orca2

-# Create a new directory in @c [ORCA2_SRC]/src/utils
    - Start by copying the directory of a similar library.
    - Edit the CMake file @c CMakeLists.txt in the new directory
    - Edit the component definition file @c mylib.def
    - Edit the documentation file @c mylib.dox
    - Modify the names of classes, namespaces, etc. using the name of your library
-# Add an entry for the new directory to the build system.
    - Edit file @c [ORCA2_SRC]/src/utils/CMakeLists.txt
    - In alphabetical order, add a line "ADD_SUBDIRECTORY ( mylib )"
