@page orca_doc_devadd_code Adding Souce Code to Orca

@note Reviewed for release 2.9.0

@see @ref orca_doc_devadd_iface

@par What is what and where does it live?

All source code is divided into 6 categories, each has a subdirectory in [ORCA_SRC]/src
-# @e Components [components]
    - Well-tested and well-documented with staticly-defined provided and required interfaces
    - Can be stand-alone executables and/or IceBox services
-# @e Utilities [utils]
    - Utility applications. This is a broad category which currently includes 
        - implementation of global services, e.g. logging, visualization
        - debugging tools,
        - utilitiies used in the build process, etc.
-# @e Libraries [libs]
        - Code which is used by more than one component or utility is put into shared libraries.
-# @e Examples [examples]
        - Components intended as examples for developers
-# @e Sandbox [sandbox]
        - Experimental and not currently maintained code. 
        - Compilation is turned off by default     

@par Adding code to the build system

-# Create a new sub-directory in the appropriate place (see above for options)
    - e.g. @c [ORCA_SRC]/src/components/mymodule for a new component
-# Edit files
    - Start by copying the directory of a similar module.
    - Edit the CMake file @c CMakeLists.txt in the new directory
    - Edit the component definition file @c mymodule.def (does not apply to libraries)
    - Edit the documentation file @c mymodule.dox
    - Modify the name of module namespace using the name of your module
-# Add an entry for the new directory to the build system.
    - Edit the file @c CMakeLists.txt in the directory @e containing your new module
        - e.g. @c [ORCA_SRC]/src/components/CMakeLists.txt for components
    - In alphabetical order, add a line "ADD_SUBDIRECTORY ( mymodule )"
