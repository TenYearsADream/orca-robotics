@par Generating skeleton implementations

Ice utility slice2cpp can generate implementation skeletons from *.ice files. We don't do it because they would then be compiled and included (unnecessarily) with libOrcaInterfaces library. So if you need to implement an interface, e.g. Home, you can generate a skeletion like this:

@verbatim
$ cd <ORCA2_SRC>/src/interfaces/slice/orca
$ slice2cpp -I<ORCA2_SRC>/src/interfaces/slice/ -I$ICE_HOME/slice --impl home.ice
$ ls home*
home.cpp  home.h  home.ice  homeI.cpp  homeI.h
@endverbatim

You can see 4 generated files: homeI.h and homeI.cpp are the skeletons. Move them to your component directory and delete home.h and home.cpp.
