@page orca_doc_documentation Documentation

Orca documentation is in HTML format and is generated by Doxygen (http://doxygen.org). You have 3 options on how to access it.

@par View On-line

- Up to date from CVS HEAD generated every 30 min: http://orca-robotics.sf.net/cvs

@par Download Arhive

- Latest release: http://orca-robotics.sf.net/orca-release-doc.tar.gz
- Up to date from CVS HEAD generated every 30 min: http://orca-robotics.sf.net/cvs_version/orca2/doc/orca-cvs-doc.tar.gz

@par Build Locally

First, download a hacked version of Doxygen from http://orca-robotics.sf.net/download/doxyorca which can compile documentation from Slice (.ice) files. This binary was compiled on Debian Linux. We have submitted a patch to Doxygen developers but haven't heard back from them.

To generate documentation, go to the @c doc directory on the top level of the Orca distribution. This works for both Orca releases and the CVS version.

@verbatim
$ cd [ORCA-SRC]/doc
$ doxyorca orca.doxyfile
@endverbatim

The documentation is created in a new directory called @c html. Open @c [ORCA-SRC]/doc/html/index.html in your browser.

If you can't download @c doxyorca or the binary doesn't work on your machine, you can use the standard version of Doxygen but you will be missing the Slice documentation for Orca interfaces.
