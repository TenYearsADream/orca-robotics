<h1>
The Orca Build System
</h1>

<p>Orca uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> to handle its build system.
CMake is a cross-platform tool, designed as a replacement for autotools.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>Builds are controlled by a set of files called 'CMakeLists.txt'.  There
is approximately one in each directory, and builds descend recursively through the source tree.</p>

<p>If you just want to see how to initiate a build, see the top-level 'INSTALL'
file in either orca-base or orca-components.</p>

<h2>Orca-Components</h2>

<p>The build system for orca-components consists of a set of 'CMakeLists.txt' files, many of which INCLUDE a set of helper '.cmake' files.  The '.cmake' files live in the top-level config directory.</p>

<p>The top-level 'CMakeLists.txt' file:
<ol>
<li>Calls config/global_setup.cmake, which checks for requirements like xerces and orca-base.</li>
<li>Checks for a bunch of things that might be needed by one or more components.  These checks set variables which can be used by components later on.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Individual components maintain their own 'CMakeLists.txt' files.  Components will generally INCLUDE the following:
<ol>
<li>config/component_rules.cmake: Contains rules for compiler/linker flags, plus any other component-kruft.</li>
<li>config/xml_install.cmake: Contains rules to install xml config files, .ocd files and .xsd files.</li>
<li>config/global_registry.cmake: Contains the macro GLOBAL_ADD_EXECUTABLE, described below.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Components should build themselves with GLOBAL_ADD_EXECUTABLE rather than ADD_EXECUTABLE.  This allows their builds to be mediated in a central location.</p>


<h2>Orca-Base</h2>

<p>In order for files to be able to '#include' header files the same when they're in situ as when they're installed, all '#included' header files live in subdirectories called 'orca'.  Source files then '#include' the directory above.</p>
