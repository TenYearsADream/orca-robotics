      <h1>What is Orca-2?</h1>

<p>Orca is an open-source framework for developing component-based robotic 
  systems. It provides the means for defining and developing the building-blocks 
  which can be pieced together to form arbitrarily complex robotic systems, from 
  single vehicles to distributed sensor networks. <a href="about.html">Read more ...</a></p>
  
<p>The documentation on this web page matches the latest release of Orca-1.  A
web page is also generated hourly from <a
href="http://orca-robotics.sourceforge.net/cvs/">the latest cvs version of Orca-2</a>.</p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>
  
<p>The initial implementation based on selectable transport mechanisms has been frozen as of version 1.0
and will only receive bug fixes in the future. The framework has been and is currently used in several projects.</p>

<p>A new implementation has been started based on the Internet Communication Engine (Ice) from
<a href="http://www.zeroc.com">ZeroC</a>. We call this implementation <b>Orca-2</b>.
Our focus on component-based sotfware remains unchanged but we feel that Ice is far superior to any
commercial and custom solutions we have looked at before. We are currently figuring out the
best way to build components on top of Ice. A new distribution will be available soon. </p>
