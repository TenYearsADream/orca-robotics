<h1>Performance of Orca Patterns</h1>

      <p>(Not yet converted to Orca2)</p>

<p>Performance of a distributed system can be measured in variety of ways. As a first step, we provide
some numbers on round trip time (RTT) for sending every type of Orca object supplied with orca-base
distribution. The plots below show average RTT for sending 100 objects. Vertical
bars show min and max values.  Ping results are shown for comparison. The test components
utilize BiPush pattern, performance of other patterns is expected to be similar.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>Intra-host communication: 2.0GHz laptop with Debian Linux (2.4 kernel). Power supplier
was plugged in.<p>

<p>Host-to-Host communication: the laptop above and a 3.2GHz desktop with Debian Linux
(2.6 kernel) 100Mb wired Ethernet. 11Mb wireless Ethernet.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Test components <code>Pinger</code> and <code>Replier</code> which can be found in
<code>orca-components/src/tests/</code>. They use BiPush communication pattern.</p>

<p>Each object type in the orca-base distribution is sent from Pinger to Replier and
immediately sent back. The process is repeated 100 times. The objects are transmitted twice
per second.</p>

<p>All libraries (libOrca*, libcrud) were compiled with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
(translates to -O3 for gcc)</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>

<p>All objects are generated using orca::setSane( ObjectType & ) call. Note that Crud transport
is limited to 16KB packets. For this reason the size of some objects (OgMap and Image)
is transport-dependent. Similarly, ping is limited to 64KB packets.</p>

<p>Compression was turned off for the objects which support it (e.g. Image).</p>

<h2>How ping tests were performed</h2>

<p>The ping settings closely follow the settings described above. RTT values are measured for
packet sizes from 16 B to 64 KB.</p>
