      <h1>Orca Units and Coordinate Systems</h1>

      <h3>Units</h3>

      <p>All component configuration is done in S.I. units (this means
      metres, seconds, etc).  The only exception to this is angular
      quantities, which are configured in degrees rather than
      radians, because humans generally think better in degrees.</p>

      <p>Internally, unless there is a good reason for doing
      otherwise, S.I. units are used everywhere (including for angular
      quantities).</p>

      <h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>

      <p>All angles are defined from -pi to pi, NOT 0 to 2pi.</p>

      <p>There are two kinds of coordinate frames: frames that are
      rooted in a global map, and a platform's local coordinate frame.</p>

      <p>For worlds where the curvature of the earth is not important,
      the global coordinate axes are defined as follows:</p>

      <p>Angles are defined anti-clockwise from the x-axis, with zero
      degrees along the x-axis.  The y-axis is at +90 degrees.  The
      z-axis points up.</p>

      <p>A local frame is defined as follows:</p>

      <img src="images/local_frame.png">

      <p>A robot or sensor looks down the x-axis, with the y-axis out
      to its left.  The z-axis points up.  Zero degrees is directly in
      front, with angles increasing to the left and decreasing to the
      right.</p>
