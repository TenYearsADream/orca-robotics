<h1>Developing Your Own Components</h1>

<p>There is no one correct way to develop software. This page will describe one way which we
found convenient. It uses CMake and closely follows the setup used for <a href="build.html">
building Orca components</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>

<p>Download the <h href="empty-components.tar.gz">tar archive</a>. Here's how to customize this thing to a
particular "user" (this is also described in empty-components/README file): After each change,
simply run 'cmake .; make' to compile.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rename
<ol>
   <li> pick a name. here it will be referred as 'user', but it could be a project, or whatever..
   <li> rename dir to user-components.
   <li> replace 'empty-components' with 'user-components' in lines 1, 5 and 6  in file
      "user-components"/CMakeLists.txt
</ol>
<li> To add a component
<ol>
   <li> add a component dir in "user-components"/src/components/
   <li>uncomment SUBDIRS block in src/components/CMakeLists.txt and add the
      name of your component.
</lo>
<li> To add an object
<ol>
   <li> add object files in "user-components"/src/objects/
   <li> uncomment 'objects' in src/CMakeLists.txt
   <li> replace 'EmptyObjects' with 'UserObjects' in lines 9 and 11 in file
      src/objects/orca/CMakeLists.txt. This will be the name of the library
      where all your object code will reside.
</ol>
<li> Maintanence
<ol>
   <li> Periodically, replace all files in "user-components"/config with the
      corresponding files from "orca-components".
</ol>
</ol>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>Run 'cmake' at the top level as you do in orca-components. Then run 'make' and 'make install'
at any level in the directory tree. Things to remember:

<ul>
<li>All component executables are installed in /usr/local/bin (same place as the standard Orca
components.)
<li>All XML files are installed in /usr/local/share/orca/ (same place as the standard Orca
XML files.)
</ul>
