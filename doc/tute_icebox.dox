@page orca_doc_tute_icebox Running components inside the IceBox server

@note Reviewed for release 2.0.0.

In this tutorial we will reproduce the setup of the @ref orca_doc_quickstart but now the SickLaser component will run as a service inside the IceBox application server.

@section orca_doc_tute_icebox_startup Start Up the Infrastructure

Make sure the IceGrid Registry is running (See @ref orca_doc_quickstart for instructions).

@section orca_doc_tute_icebox_talk Connect Two Components

First, copy default configuration files for the SickLaser and LaserMon components.
@verbatim
$ cd ~/sys; mkdir tuteicebox; cd tuteicebox
$ cp [ORCA2-INSTALL]/cfg/sicklaser.cfg .
$ cp [ORCA2-INSTALL]/cfg/lasermon.cfg .
@endverbatim

Also, copy the IceBox configuration file for this tutorial, included with you Orca distribution.
@verbatim
$ cp [ORCA2-SRC]/scripts/icebox_laser.cfg .
$ mkdir stormdb
@endverbatim

@par The IceBox Server

The IceBox configuration file does not need to be modifed. It instructs the IceBox to first load the IceStorm service and then the SickLaser service. Both are configured to share one instance of Communicator which speeds up communication.

The laser config file needs to be changed to fake (simulated) operation (or skip this step if you're connected to a real SICK laser).  Edit @c sicklaser.cfg, and replace @e 'sickcarmen' with @e 'fake' so it looks like this:

@verbatim
SickLaser.Config.Driver=fake
@endverbatim

Start the IceBox.

@verbatim
$ icebox --Ice.Config=icebox_laser.cfg
@endverbatim

@par The Client

Start a new shell, and fire up the LaserMon component (a laser monitor). No modifications are needed for its configuration file. Note that the name of the configuration file is not specified on the command line and it is assumed to be @c lasermon.cfg.

@verbatim
$ lasermon
@endverbatim

You should see the scans scroll by on the screen, just as in the @ref orca_doc_quickstart_startup tutorial. To stop the IceBox or the component, type @c Ctrl-C.
