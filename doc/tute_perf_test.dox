@page orca_doc_tute_perf_test Testing Orca Latencies

@note Reviewed for release 2.0.0.

In this tutorial we show how to use two utilities to measure communication latencies. The utilities are @ref orca_test_pinger and @ref orca_test_replier. The results we produce will be similar to those shown in @ref orca_doc_performance.

We assume that the IceGrid registry is already running (see earlier tutorials on how to do this). Create a system directory and copy default configuration files.

@verbatim
$ cd ~/sys; mkdir perftest; cd perftest
$ cp [ORCA2-INSTALL]/cfg/replier.cfg .
$ cp [ORCA2-INSTALL]/cfg/pinger.cfg .
@endverbatim

@section orca_doc_tute_perftest_replier Start up Replier

We start the replier first.

@verbatim
$ replier
@endverbatim

@section orca_doc_tute_perftest_pinger Start up Pinger

Edit the configuration file @c pinger.cfg : change the number of pings from 101 to 5, so you don't have to wait a long time. You'll end up with something like this:

@verbatim
# Configuration Options
Pinger.Config.Count=5
Pinger.Config.Interval=0.250
Pinger.Config.LogFileName=orcapingresults.dat
Pinger.Config.Preload=1
Pinger.Config.UseIcePing=0
@endverbatim

@verbatim
$ pinger
@endverbatim

The results are saved in a text file called @c orcapingresults.dat. Each line corresponds to multiple pings of the same data structure and contains the following:

@verbatim
SIZE RTT_MIN RTT_AVG RTT_MAX RTT_MDEV  RTT0 RTT1 RTT2 ... RTTN
@endverbatim

Where SIZE is the size of the data structure in bytes. RTT stands for Round-Trip Time and are stored in milliseconds. RTT_MDEV is standard deviation of the data set (currently not implemented). Note that the contents are similar to the output of UNIX ping.
