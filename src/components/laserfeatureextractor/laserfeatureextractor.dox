@brief Extracts interesting features from laser scans

@par Provides

- @ref orca_interface_home
- @ref orca_interface_polarfeature2d
- @ref orca_interface_status

@par Requires

- @ref orca_interface_laser

The component receives features from laser scans, useful for navigation. Types of features extracted:

- reflectors: anything with high reflectivity
- foreground points: things like poles or trees
- corners: internal and external corners eg. of buildings
- doors: gaps in walls of a certain width


@par Configuration

The configuration documentation is split into sections for each feature type

Reflectors

- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.ExtractReflectors (bool)
    - Default: true
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.BackgroundRangeGate
    - George/Stef, what does this do?
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.TargetRangeGate (float) [m]
    - Minimum range to target to be considered as a point feature.
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.MinReturnNumber (int)
    - Minimum number of bright laser returns to be considered as a point feature.
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.MinBrightness (int)
    - minimum intensity value to be considered a feature
    - Default: 1

Foreground Points

- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.ExtractForegroundPoints (bool)
    - boolean
    - Default: 0
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.MinForegroundWidth (float) [m]
    - minimum width of poles/trees
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.MaxForegroundWidth (float) [m]
    - maximum width of poles/trees
- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.MinForegroundBackgroundSeparation (float) [m]
    - how far the pole/tree must be from the background

Corners

- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.ExtractCorners (bool)
    - Default: 0
    
Doors

- @c LaserFeatureExtractor.Config.ExtractDoors (bool)
    - Default: 0

An example configuration file is installed into [ORCA-INSTALL-DIR]/cfg/ directory.
