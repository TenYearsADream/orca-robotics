 * svdcomp - SVD decomposition routine. 
 * Takes an mxn matrix a and decomposes it into udv, where u,v are
 * left and right orthogonal transformation matrices, and d is a 
 * diagonal matrix of singular values.
 *
 * This routine is adapted from svdecomp.c in XLISP-STAT 2.1 which is 
 * code from Numerical Recipes adapted by Luke Tierney and David Betz.
 *
 * Input to dsvd is as follows:
 *   a = mxn matrix to be decomposed, gets overwritten with u
 *   m = row dimension of a
 *   n = column dimension of a
 *   w = returns the vector of singular values of a
 *   v = returns the right orthogonal transformation matrix
