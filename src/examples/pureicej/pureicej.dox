@defgroup orca_component_pureicej PureIceJ
@brief An example of Orca component written in Java.

@par Provides

- none

@par Requires

- @ref orca_interface_laser

Example code intended for component developers.

To test the component, follow the directions of the @ref orca_doc_quickstart. After the SickLaser is up and running, start PureIceJ example which will connect to the server, get a single laser scan, and exit. The following line must be executed from the build directory of PureIceJ. We assume here that Ice.jar is placed into $ICE_HOME/lib directory.

@verbatim
$ export ICEJ_HOME=$ICE_HOME
$ java -cp $ICEJ_HOME/lib/Ice.jar:../../interfaces/java/orca.jar:./PureIceJ.jar PureIceJ --Ice.Default.Locator='IceGrid/Locator:default -p 12000'
@endverbatim

Note that PureIceJ does not use any configuration files. All connection parameters are hard-wired into the code, so you have to follow the directions of the tutorial exactly, otherwise it will not work.
