# Notes on the actual implementatation of the peak can library
# libpcan as of version 6.0

Calls to:
LINUX_CAN_Read
LINUX_CAN_Write
CAN_VersionInfo

These eventually trickle down to calls to ioctl and return parameter
passed back by ioctl

Notes from the man page for ioctl for a posix implementation
" RETURN VALUE
  On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1  is  returned,
  and errno is set appropriately."

However looking at the implementation in the driver code it looks like all the
functions that have DWORD return values return +ve error value in the event of a problem. 
These are set to what would have been errno. Zero equates to success.
