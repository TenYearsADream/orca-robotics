@brief A fake implementation useful for debugging.

read() returns fake odometry at configurable rate.

write() simulates hardware failure when commanded velocity exceeds 2m/s by throwing exception.

The rest of the functions do nothing.

@par Configuration

- @c Fake.SleepInterval (int)
  - Time spent sleeping before returning from read() function.
  - Simulates configurable data rate. This value does NOT set the data rate
    exactly because the time spent between calls to read() are not taken into
    acount.
  - Units: milliseconds
  - Constraints: non-negative integer (throws gbxutilacfr::Exception when not satisfied)
  - Default: 1000

@par Dependencies.

- libIceUtil (for timing)
