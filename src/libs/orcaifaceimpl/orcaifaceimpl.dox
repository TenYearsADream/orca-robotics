@section orca_library_orcaifaceimpl_usage Usage

The function initInterface() may throw orcaice::Exceptions. When calling from within a thread, you should set up a loop:
@verbatim
while ( isActive() ) {
    try {
        obj->initInterface();
    }
    catch ( const Ice::Exception& e ) {
        // give feedback
        context_.tracer()->warning( "Failed to setup interface: " << e << ". Check Registry and IceStorm. Will try again in 2 secs...");
        IceUtil::ThreadControl::sleep(IceUtil::Time::seconds(2));
    }
}
@endverbatim
